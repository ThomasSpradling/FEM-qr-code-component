## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

This was a good introduction to design——an area web development that I am not as good with. Going from design to CSS sometimes is challenging, and getting a handle of this has been great. I am fairly new to Tailwind, so I am trying to pick up tricks along the way with that too.
